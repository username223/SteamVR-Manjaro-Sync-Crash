## Minimum sample for issue causing SteamVR crash on Manjaro using Sync()

The following code crashes SteamVR on Manjaro on an i7-6700K, even with a relatively long wait time of 1 second. 

The same code does not cause a SEGFAULT on Windows on the same processor.

To run, write `make` in the terminal. This will build and run the main.cpp file.
